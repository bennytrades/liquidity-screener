# ðŸ“ˆ Liquidity Screener Dashboard

A real-time liquidity screener built with **React**, **Firebase Firestore**, and **Vercel**. This tool helps traders monitor when crypto pairs hit key liquidity levels and instantly receive Discord alerts.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-Time Updates (Firestore onSnapshot listener)  
- Tracks Key Levels: `PDH`, `PDL`, `PWH`, `PWL`, `iHOD`, `iLOD`, `1H LVL`, `4H LVL`, `GAP FILLED`  
- Color-coded Level Badges  
- Discord Alerts on New Events  
- Card Timers Showing Time Since Alert  
- Clean, Responsive UI  
- Ability to Manually Remove (Dismiss) Alerts

## ðŸ“š How It Works

1. **TradingView Webhook Alerts**  
   - You set up alerts in TradingView using this JSON format:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "{{ticker}}",
       "level": "PDH",
       "exchange": "{{exchange}}"
     }
     ```
   - The webhook URL you provide is your deployed Vercel API endpoint:  
     `https://<your-vercel-app>.vercel.app/api/webhook`

2. **Vercel Serverless API**  
   - The API (`api/webhook.js`) receives incoming webhooks and:
     - Stores the alert in Firestore.
     - Sends a Discord message using a configured webhook.

3. **React Frontend**  
   - Hosted on Vercel, connects directly to Firestore to listen for real-time data.
   - Displays liquidity events as cards with time counters.
   - Allows manual deletion of events directly from the dashboard.

4. **Discord Alerts**  
   - Alerts are sent via Discord webhooks in this format:
     ```
     ðŸš¨ Liquidity Event  
     Pair: BTCUSDT  
     Level: PDH  
     
     Open the chart and look for reversal signs!
     ```
